# Promise Shop

## Instructions

Install dependencies with

```
npm install
```

To view and select the exercises,

```
npm start
```

For help,

npm run help
```

Create a file for each workshop, e.g. `1-warm-up.js` and add your solution to the problem.

To run your solution,

```
npm run exe
```

To verify your solution,

For example, if your file is called `2-fulfill-a-promise.js`, you can run and verify your code like this

```
npm run exe -- 2-fulfill-a-promise.js
npm run verify -- 2-fulfill-a-promise.js
```
